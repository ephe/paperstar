As a Christmas gift to myself, I nuked my old website from orbit and started clean with Jekyll.

Admittedly, I have *no* clue what I'm doing at the moment, but there's really no harm in trying to get this to work, is there? There's a level of childish glee, though, in typing a blog post in a text editor rather than, y'know, a fancy word-professor. It doesn't have visual markup, but I do end up playing more thought onto how and when I emphasize text just by needing to type *more* out to achieve the emphasis, and plus there are small comforts (multi-select, for example, or auto-closing parentheses) that are nice to work with.

I don't know that I'd be comfortable writing a long document in this, but for something generally more casual, it's not half-bad at all.

...definitely need to put some time into learning Markdown though; it reminds me a lot of old-school wikis, before all of that visual editing stuff. Beautiful stuff, sometimes, but it's awful hard to get precisely the result you want as well.
