As a Christmas gift to myself, I nuked my old website from orbit and started clean with Jekyll.

Admittedly, I have *no* clue what I'm doing at the moment, but that's part of the fun. Jekyll has, despite some setbacks, been great to set up and learn; gone are the days where sweating over SQL queries and trying to fix sluggish databases was just the status quo. No doubt I'll run into problems down the line with this new setup, but it's been refreshing to play with static pages after so long with generated content, and produces a small, tidy site that seems like it'll be easier to maintain and change on the fly.

Too, there's a level of childish glee in typing a blog post in a text editor rather than, y'know, some fancy rich-text processor. Visual markup is great on a more substantial project, of course, but for a space where I'm just tapping out words, there's no need for that extra bulk &mdash; I want to keep this little corner nimble rather than flashy. The mere act of explicitly specify additional styling also keeps me from *needlessly* abusing emphasis (most of the time). Plus all of those text editor comforts are now available, like multi-selecting or auto-completing parentheses (which is useful given how many parentheticals end up slipping into any prose that my fingers touch).

All in all, not half-bad.
